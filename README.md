PART 1: THEORETICAL ANALYSIS (40%)
1. Edge AI vs Cloud-based AI (Latency & Privacy)
Answer:

Edge AI refers to the processing of AI algorithms on local devices (e.g., smartphones, drones, Raspberry Pi) rather than sending data to cloud servers. This leads to two main benefits: reduced latency and enhanced privacy.

Reduced Latency: Since data is processed locally, there’s no need to transmit it to distant servers. This enables real-time decision-making, which is critical in applications like autonomous drones. For example, a drone inspecting power lines can detect faults and make flight adjustments instantly without waiting for cloud-based responses.

Enhanced Privacy: Edge AI keeps sensitive data (like images or health info) on-device. This minimizes risks of interception or breaches. In smart homes, for instance, facial recognition on a local camera prevents raw video from being sent online, protecting user privacy.

Real-world Example:
DJI drones use onboard AI to detect and avoid obstacles. This ensures flight safety even in areas with weak or no internet connectivity—something cloud-based AI would struggle with.

2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization
Answer:

Classical AI uses traditional computing (binary logic) to perform optimization. Quantum AI leverages qubits that can represent multiple states simultaneously (superposition), and quantum entanglement, which allows faster exploration of solution spaces.

Quantum AI Strength: It can solve complex problems like route optimization, molecule simulation, and portfolio management exponentially faster than classical AI.

Industries that benefit most:

Logistics: Quantum AI can optimize delivery routes in real-time, reducing fuel and time.

Finance: Simulating many investment strategies quickly for risk prediction.

Pharma: Accelerating drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions efficiently.

3. Societal Impact of Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
Answer:

Human-AI collaboration in healthcare reshapes how medical professionals work. Instead of replacing roles, AI enhances them.

Radiologists: AI models can detect tumors or fractures in scans faster and with high accuracy. Radiologists become supervisors—verifying AI output, focusing on complex cases, and providing emotional support to patients.

Nurses: AI-driven chatbots and robots can handle routine tasks (e.g., monitoring vitals, scheduling meds), giving nurses more time for human care.

Societal Impacts:

Reduced medical errors.

Faster diagnosis and treatment.

Equity concerns if AI systems are biased.

📚 Example: Zebra Medical Vision AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases from X-rays with high accuracy.

4. Case Study Critique: AI-IoT in Smart Cities (Traffic Management)
Answer:

AI-IoT Integration in smart cities enables traffic systems to become intelligent and adaptive.

How It Works: IoT sensors collect real-time traffic data (vehicle count, speed, congestion). AI algorithms predict and optimize signal timing, reducing congestion and pollution.

Benefits for Sustainability:

Decreases fuel waste and CO₂ emissions.

Encourages public transport by reducing delays.

Two Key Challenges:

Data Security: Smart traffic systems are vulnerable to hacking. A compromised system could cause accidents or jams.

Interoperability: Cities use varied hardware/software from different vendors, making integration complex and error-prone.

📚 Real-world: Barcelona uses AI-IoT to optimize bus traffic and reduce emissions.
